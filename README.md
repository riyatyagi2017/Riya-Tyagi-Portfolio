## [PROJECT1.Stock-Price-Prediction-Minor-Project-Riya-Tyagi-](https://github.com/riyatyagi2017/Stock-Price-Prediction-Minor-Project-Riya-Tyagi-)
Machine learning is used to predict the future value of a company's stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. The main point of forecasting stock prices is to make large gains. Predicting how the stock market will perform is a hard task to do. There are other factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make share prices dynamic and volatile. This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy.

## [PROJECT2. Wine-Quality-Analysis-Major-Project](https://github.com/riyatyagi2017/Wine-Quality-Analysis-Major-Project)
Wine industry shows a recent growth spurt as social drinking is on the rise. The price of wine depends on a rather abstract concept of wine appreciation by wine tasters, opinion among whom may have a high degree of variability. Pricing of wine depends on such a volatile factor to some extent. Another key factor in wine certification and quality assessment is physicochemical tests which are laboratory-based and takes into account factors like acidity, pH level, the presence of sugar and other chemical properties. For the wine market, it would be of interest if human quality of tasting can be related to the chemical properties of wine so that certification and quality assessment and assurance process is more controlled.
